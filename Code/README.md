## Goal
To expedite skin cancer diagnosis using Microsoft Custom Vision and data about the social determinants of health.

## Code Files
Two code files are included in the following repository:
- R code that combines many external data sources and simulates patient data to add demographics and information on the social determinants of health to improve model.prediction accuracy.
    - Code file: data_generation_code.R: 
- Python code that takes the data and the output from the Custom Vision AI model to predict a "risk score" for skin cancer to expedite early diagnosis.
    - Code file: tech_serum_ml_code_final.ipynb

## Data Files
- Please see documentation about sources for input data sources
- Clean modeling file: tech_serum_hackathon_data.csv
